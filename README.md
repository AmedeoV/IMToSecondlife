# IMToSecondlife

This was a prototype that got quite famous after I published a WebView showing this MVC site on Google Play Store.

After 3 years it got 27000 downloads and roughly 2000 users were using this App everyday.

Unfortunately I didn't realize that I was breaking the Linden Lab Policy, so I had to remove the app.

This is the code used, it's a simple MVC Website using SignalR2, this was my first project when I started to learn on how to code in C#

Feel free to use it and change it as you wish!

If you want to publish an app with this code, make sure you connect to login.secondlife.com directly from the user phone - do not host this website on a server or you'll get in trouble with Linden Lab.
